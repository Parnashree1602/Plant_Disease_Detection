    Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection System! ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬
    
    Our goal is to support accurate and timely identification of plant diseases. Upload a plant image, and our system will analyze it to detect possible diseases, helping to safeguard crops and promote a healthier harvest.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Head over to the **Disease Detection** page and submit an image of the plant youâ€™d like examined.
    2. **Image Analysis:** Our system uses advanced algorithms to examine the image and identify any signs of disease.
    3. **Receive Results:** Get an instant assessment along with suggested next steps.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **High Accuracy:** Our system leverages cutting-edge machine learning models to ensure precise disease detection.
    - **Easy to Use:** With a streamlined and intuitive interface, identifying plant diseases is straightforward.
    - **Quick Results:** Obtain insights within seconds, facilitating fast decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Visit the **Disease Detection** page in the sidebar to upload an image and see how our Plant Disease Detection System can help.

                #### About the Dataset
                This dataset has been generated through offline augmentation based on the original collection, which is available on GitHub. It contains approximately 87,000 RGB images of crop leaves, both healthy and affected by various diseases, organized into 38 distinct classes. For effective training, the dataset has been split into training and validation sets in an 80/20 ratio, maintaining the original folder structure.

                Additionally, a separate folder with 33 test images has been created specifically for prediction purposes.
                
                #### Dataset Structure
                1. Train Set: 70,295 images
                2. Validation Set: 17,572 images
                3. Test Set: 33 images
